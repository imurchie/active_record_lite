Active Record Lite
==================

This is a project to reimplement some of the functionality of [ActiveRecord](http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord). In particular, it deals with:
1. Simple DB interfacing, without any schema interaction.
2. Associations
  - belongs_to
  - has_many
  - has_one_through
