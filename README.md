Active Record Lite
==================

This is a project to reimplement some of the functionality of [ActiveRecord](http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveRecord). In particular, it deals with:

1. Simple DB interfacing, without any schema interaction.
2. Associations (belongs_to has_many, has_one_through).
